#Example for data science class
I made this cool project for lpl

#How it works 

enter kill, death, assistance, damage delt, damege taken, and gold earn in the input part, and you will get result from output

#explain why it is cool

Do you know that there is now a well-known game League of Legends. It holds some tournaments every year, and in China the name of this tournament is called LPL, which 
is similar to NBA. I counted the play of some famous top players in lpl. Their ids are, summit, theshy, rich and flandre. I used these data to make a mod. this mod 
can help some clubs to get the players they want. For example, when a rookie top player finishes a match, input his data into this mod and you can get his style 
of play. If it shows "theshy", then it means that the player is very aggressive on the field and can be the core of the team. If it shows "rich", then it means that 
the player can still produce high output in team battles even if he is not given too much resources. And if a club needs a top player who can help the other menbers 
team during the game, then they can choose the player with result "flandre". And if they want a top player with a magnificent kda, then "summit" is a quality option.
